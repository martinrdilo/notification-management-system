# Notification Management System

[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/martinrdilo/notification-management-system/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/martinrdilo/notification-management-system/tree/main)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/martinrdilo/notification-management-system/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/martinrdilo/notification-management-system?branch=main)

REST API for notification management with JWT authentication and simulated multi-channel delivery (Email, SMS, Push). Built as a take-home technical challenge.

## 🚀 Live Demo

A running instance is deployed on Railway — no setup required:

**[🔗 Open Swagger](https://feisty-gratitude-production-a5d2.up.railway.app/swagger-ui/index.html)**

How to test:
1. **Register**: `POST /auth/register` with a username, email, and password
2. **Login**: `POST /auth/login` with the same credentials — copy the JWT token from the response
3. **Authorize**: Click the 🔒 **Authorize** button in Swagger, paste the token, and click Authorize
4. **Try it out**: all authenticated endpoints are now available — create notifications, list them, update, delete

## Features

- **User registration & login** with JWT authentication (stateless)
- **CRUD for notifications**: create, read, update, delete
- **Multi-channel simulated delivery**: Email, SMS, and Push — each with channel-specific validation and formatting
- **Ownership enforcement**: users can only access their own notifications (IDOR protection)
- **Open/Closed Principle**: adding a new channel requires zero changes to existing code
- **Swagger UI**: interactive API documentation at `/swagger-ui.html`

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd backend-challenge

# 2. Build and start the app + PostgreSQL
./run-app.sh

# Or manually:
docker compose up -d
./gradlew bootRun
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`. Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication (`/auth`)

|--------|------|-------------|------|
| POST | `/auth/register` | Register a new user (username, email, password) | No |
| POST | `/auth/login` | Log in, returns JWT | No |

### Notifications (`/notifications`)

| Method | Path | Description | Auth |
|--------|------|-------------|------|
| GET | `/notifications` | List authenticated user's notifications | Bearer |
| GET | `/notifications/{id}` | Get notification by ID (own only) | Bearer |
| POST | `/notifications` | Create notification (triggers simulated channel delivery) | Bearer |
| PUT | `/notifications/{id}` | Update notification (title, content, attachmentIds) | Bearer |
| DELETE | `/notifications/{id}` | Delete notification (own only) | Bearer |

### Create Notification — Request

```json
POST /notifications
{
  "title": "System Alert",
  "content": "Server requires scheduled maintenance.",
  "channel": "EMAIL",
  "attachmentIds": [1, 2]
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "System Alert",
  "content": "Server requires scheduled maintenance.",
  "channel": "EMAIL",
  "status": "SENT",
  "createdAt": "2026-05-10T01:30:00",
  "userId": 1,
  "attachments": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "photo-1", "url": "https://..." }
  ]
}
```

## Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with Docker
./run-tests.sh

# Or manually:
./gradlew test
```

**Current coverage**: 101 tests (unit + integration), 0 failures.

- **Unit**: `MockitoExtension`, no Spring context. Each sender and service tested in isolation.
- **Integration**: `Testcontainers` (real PostgreSQL) + `WireMock` (external API) + `WebTestClient` (HTTP).

## Architecture Highlights

### Stateless JWT Authentication

Spring Security with a JWT filter and no server-side session (`SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS`). Every request carries the token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The `JwtAuthFilter` sets the `SecurityContext` before requests reach controllers. Enables horizontal scaling without sticky sessions.

### Strategy Pattern for Channel Delivery (OCP)

Channel delivery uses the Strategy pattern with Spring's auto-discovery. Each channel is a `@Component` implementing `ChannelSender`, and the `ChannelDispatcher` builds a `Map<Channel, ChannelSender>` for O(1) dispatch. Delivery is simulated (logging only), with each channel applying its own validation and formatting.

**Adding a new channel** (e.g. WhatsApp) requires only two steps with zero changes to existing code:
1. Add `WHATSAPP` to the `Channel` enum
2. Create `WhatsAppChannelSender implements ChannelSender` as a `@Component`

Spring auto-detects it and the dispatcher picks it up — satisfying the Open/Closed Principle.

### Ownership Enforcement (IDOR protection)

Endpoints that access a notification by ID validate it belongs to the authenticated user via `findOwnNotification(id)`. Mismatch returns **403 Forbidden**; not found returns **404**. Prevents Insecure Direct Object Reference attacks.

### Implicit User Derivation

`GET /notifications` derives the user from the `SecurityContext` instead of exposing a `userId` in the URL. Avoids exposing user IDs in the API — the auth context determines which data is returned.

### Constructor Injection

All dependencies use constructor injection (no `@Autowired`). Dependencies are explicit, objects immutable post-construction, and unit testing with Mockito is trivial without a Spring context.

### Immutable Channel on Update

`PUT /notifications/{id}` uses `NotificationUpdateRequest`, a DTO that excludes the `channel` field. Once dispatched through a channel, it can't be changed — there's no business case for "un-sending."

### Integration Tests with Real Infrastructure

Integration tests use real PostgreSQL via Testcontainers, WireMock for the external API, and `WebTestClient` for HTTP. The database is never mocked. Catches real SQL dialect differences and constraint issues.

## Areas to Improve

Tradeoffs and improvements I'd make with more time:

- **Database migrations**: replace `ddl-auto=update` with Flyway or Liquibase for production-grade schema versioning
- **Error handling**: adopt RFC 7807 Problem Details (`application/problem+json`) for structured, machine-readable error responses
- **Seed data**: add a seed migration or data initializer so the app starts with sample users and notifications
- **Rate limiting**: protect auth endpoints against brute-force attacks

## Known Issues

None at this time.
